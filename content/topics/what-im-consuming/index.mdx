This page serves two purposes: firstly and most importantly, it helps me keep track of things I've read, 
listened to, or watched, that I thought were interesting and may want to explore more deeply in the future. 
Secondly, I get to share it with all of you. Hopefully, you find some of it interesting and even useful.

[https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/)

Probably the best source I've found to learn about trends in AI, how we should think about AI, and how to apply it for good.

I became a certified AWS solutions architect! I may post in the future about what I leared about AWS services during the course, and
more interestingly, what I learned about learning :)

Studying for this was the main reason that I took a break from posting.

A nice summary of how to work with difficult coworkers and maintain composure by assuming best intent.

### 2023-09-21

I read the [First Law Trilogy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11706669-the-first-law-trilogy). Not sure what is says about me, but I liked the dark and violent turn the series took.

I'm nearly done with [The Witcher](https://www.netflix.com/title/80189685) (season 3). I kept watching it because the characters were interesting to me. I wanted to know how they would grow and change. Admittedly, I also wanted to see more awesome fight scenes with Geralt taking down monsters.

### 2023-07-16

[The Witcher](https://www.netflix.com/title/80189685) (season 1) was strangely compelling. Because the viewer has to piece together the events that happen in different timelines (Geralt, Yen, and Ciri), it engaged my interest more than usual. The background and purpose of Geralt is also intriguing.

### 2023-07-10

I watched a little bit of [The Witcher](https://www.netflix.com/title/80189685).

Not sure I'm going to continue. I am looking for some reason to care about / be interested in the main characters. On a scale of `I don't care` to `I care a lot` I'm in the middle. Meh. We shall see.

[Wokeism is Marxism](https://youtu.be/y6rk1mYiOAw)

The speaker shows how the foundations of `Marxism` have been seized, changed, and adapted over the last 150+ years. But instead of economic control, the main goal of the most recent adaptations, including those in Maoist China and Wokeist America, has been an attempt to gain control over cultural institutions, and therefore the people themselves. Your life is no longer your own; it belongs to the state. Because of the grand vision the Marxists present, many people beg for deliverance.

[The Ayn Rand Money Speech](https://www.capitalismmagazine.com/2002/08/franciscos-money-speech/)

If money is the root of all evil, what is the root of all money? `Work` that produces `value`, which can be `voluntarily exchanged` with the `value` that the `work of others` has produced. Money can never be evil; only the rot and corruption within a person can be used to obtain money through `evil` means.

I like this explanation because it explains why capitalism makes people as happy and prosperous as possible. And, it also explains that money itself is not the evil that produces human degradation, but rather the malicious motives of those will exploit others. In the end, their conscience may win out, and they may declare that money is evil because the money was so tempting, they just had to do the bad thing. This is bonkers! We have conscious control over more decisions than we dare imagine!

[Render Unto the Machine](https://theconvivialsociety.substack.com/p/render-unto-the-machine)

This article caused me to pause and think about the nature and purpose of `AI`. I agree with the author that rather than being a drastic break from the tech adoption trend, it's more likely a continuation that will mostly be used to automate:

1. Things we don't like to do
1. Things we think are pointless but someone else wants us to do
1. Things that other software programs require us to do to fulfill the needs of the software
Thus, it is reasonable (we also have an obligation) to render unto AI what is AI's, and render unto God what is God's, as we always have.
