This page serves two purposes: firstly and most importantly, it helps me keep track of things I've read, listened to, or watched, that I thought were interesting and may want to explore more deeply in the future. Secondly, I get to share it with all of you. Hopefully, you find some of it interesting and even useful.

[Wokeism is Marxism](https://youtu.be/y6rk1mYiOAw)

The speaker shows how the foundations of `Marxism` have been seized, changed, and adapted over the last 150+ years. But instead of economic control, the main goal of the most recent adaptations, including those in Maoist China and Wokeist America, has been an attempt to gain control over cultural institutions, and therefore the people themselves. Your life is no longer your own; it belongs to the state. Because of the grand vision the Marxists present, many people beg for deliverance.

[The Ayn Rand Money Speech](https://www.capitalismmagazine.com/2002/08/franciscos-money-speech/)

If money is the root of all evil, what is the root of all money? `Work` that produces `value`, which can be `voluntarily exchanged` with the `value` that the `work of others` has produced. Money can never be evil; only the rot and corruption within a person can be used to obtain money through `evil` means.

I like this explanation because it explains why capitalism makes people as happy and prosperous as possible. And, it also explains that money itself is not the evil that produces human degradation, but rather the malicious motives of those will exploit others. In the end, their conscience may win out, and they may declare that money is evil because the money was so tempting, they just had to do the bad thing. This is bonkers! We have conscious control over more decisions than we dare imagine!

[Render Unto the Machine](https://theconvivialsociety.substack.com/p/render-unto-the-machine)

This article caused me to pause and think about the nature and purpose of `AI`. I agree with the author that rather than being a drastic break from the tech adoption trend, it's more likely a continuation that will mostly be used to automate:
1. Things we don't like to do
1. Things we think are pointless but someone else wants us to do
1. Things that other software programs require us to do to fulfill the needs of the software
Thus, it is reasonable (we also have an obligation) to render unto AI what is AI's, and render unto God what is God's, as we always have.
