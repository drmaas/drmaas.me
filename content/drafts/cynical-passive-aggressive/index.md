Some of the more cynical/aggressive/passive-aggressive strategies I've seen for career advancement:

* delay your responses to coworkers to focus on your own growth and advancement. Later on apologize for not responding, coming up with excuses such as you missed the notification, your calendar wasn't working, or you had a personal emergency.
* when working on a critical project, create confusion and dissonance by talking in endless circles until no one knows what you're talking about. I call this the `upwards spiral of abstraction`. Instead of descending into Hell, you end up in Heaven. By the time you're done doing your deed, there will be an opportunity for someone to come in and restore order. You just happen to be the right person for the job!
* Fail upwards. This is, I believe, a similar strategy that I heard about in finance, where 1) you only lose other people's money and 2) the more money you lose, the more vision it demonstrates. Hey, you got unlucky, but look at those management skills. You must be promoted! Similarly, in tech, aggressively take on as much responsibility as possible. If the project goes off the rails, you'll be fine, as you'll be seen as an ambitious go-getter. If the project is successful due to the hard work and determination of others, even better. Either way, you are just begging for a promotion.
