I think of this in terms of ownership, store of value, and payments.</li>\n<li>Crypto. Separate from Bitcoin. Mainly Ethereum. I think of this as a distributed computer for the internet.</li>\n<li>Politics and Economics. How does our government work, what is it doing, and what should it reasonably be allowed to do?</li>\n<li>Health. This includes food, exercise, and mental health. I've been practicing Yoga for 12+ years and have thoughts on how to heal mind and body.</li>\n<li>Everything else. I like to learn about a wide variety of topics.
