I am going to start a blog. Finally. My biggest challenge will be coming up with content.
Some of my interests include:

* software engineering (currently building out the digital platform [@salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com))
* Bitcoin. I think of this in terms of ownership, store of value, and payments.
* Crypto. Separate from Bitcoin. Mainly Ethereum. I think of this as a distributed computer for the internet.
* Politics and Economics. How does our government work, what is it doing, and what should it reasonably be allowed to do?
* Health. This includes food, exercise, and mental health. I've been practicing Yoga for 12+ years and have thoughts on how to heal mind and body.
* Everything else. I like to learn about a wide variety of topics. Ultimately, I spend time making connections between seemingly unrelated realms.

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.
