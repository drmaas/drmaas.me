Again I laid awake in bed in the middle of the night, my thoughts turning like a tempest. The world is changing at a rate we haven't seen in our lifetime. This is the source of great anxiety to me and to many. To deal with this, my mind tends to ruminate and parse apart the torrent of information it receives throughout the course of a day. On this night, I just wanted to go back to sleep so that I wasn't exhausted the next day. 

So I asked God for help. As a software engineer working on distributed systems, I think about networks a lot. How do they connect, what are their characteristics, how stable are they, things like that. I imagined that if God could only plug Himself into my mind with an Ethernet cable, I'd finally know the Truth and I'd be abe to put my mind ease.

And so it happened. One moment I was wide awake, the next, I was trasported to some other place, though I thought I was still awake. I kept touching things and examining them in detail to check if they were real or not. I could sense that cell phones were real because I could touch them. I also knew that roads and houses were real because I had the ability to zoom on with my eyesight, like I had built in microcopes in my eyes.

I came to a narrow gorge with cliffs festooned with plants and trees. At the bottom was a kind of city, with people wandering around and shopping immaculate shopping centers. It was sunny but cool and misty. We were near water. As I was walking toward the city I came to a security guard's desk. He appeared to be some sort of gatekeeper, but he was very meek in appearance, and also shy. I asked him if he was an Angel, and he said yes, though he was embarrassed to have to say it out loud - I think I was supposed to know. He guarded the city, but had no army and carried no weapons. He said his name was Mike. I touched him to see if he had a real body, and I couldn't feel anything. This led me to believe that he was an Angel. 

A ways up the cliff, an eternal mass was being offered. People were not gathered like in our traditional masses, but they came and went to take the Eucharist. The mass was an eternal offering of the Eucharist. The organs played an endless stream of music, magestic, mystical, and full of emotion.

Looking back on this vision, think God listened to me and plugged me in to himself, revealing Heaven. I am sure my mind put a worldly twist on things since I could only perceive that with which my mind was already familiar. Mike was really the Archangel Michael, defending Heaven.The people living there were the fullest realization of true human beings. They simply existed in full and eternal communion with God through the sacrifice of Jesus. Peace reigned.
