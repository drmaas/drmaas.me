## Iowa Road Trip

Recently, my daughters and I took a road trip to Iowa. Why Iowa? We live relatively close (4 hours to Saint Paul MN), and the trip fit within our budget to drive there. We had only been there once before, to Indian Mounds National Monument, and wanted to explore some other areas. I found the history of the area to be much deeper than I realized. I think I assumed that Iowa was just corn and didn't have much there. I was certainly wrong!

### Day 1

We started out at 8 in the morning and drove straight from St. Paul to [Ledges State Park](https://www.iowadnr.gov/Places-to-Go/State-Parks/Iowa-State-Parks/Ledges-State-Park). We were blessed with a very warm day, at least for March - it got up to 65 degrees Fahrenheit. We nicknamed this park up-down park because of all of the stairways going up and down the hills and bluffs.

Since it wasn't time to check in to our Airbnb yet, we decided to go to [Blank Park Zoo](https://www.blankparkzoo.com/). On each trip I take, I like to see the local zoo. Here, we got to zee Giraffes up closer than I've seen at other zoos, and they had a red panda!

After that, we got dinner at [Dough Company Pizza](https://doughcodsm.com/) and walked around the [Drake University](https://www.drake.edu/) Campus.

### Day 2

We started early in the morning so that we could tour both the state capitol building and the history museum. We got to the capitol early enough to snag a visitor parking spot right by the entrance. The state capitol building was really busy - congress was in session and hundreds of lobbyists, members of various companies and organizations, and a few tourists congregated on the main floor. We wound our way to the second floor and then the third floor, where the public sits to listen to congressional debates.

After that, we went to the State History Museum down the street from the capitol. I was floored by the volume of exhibits. We learned about natural history, native peoples, pioneer settlements, political history, and the Civil War. We skipped over the Hollywood part, and only watched a video about [Ragbrai](https://ragbrai.com/). 

After lunch we visited the [Des Moines Botanical Garden](https://dmbotanicalgarden.com/). The highlight was the gardener's show house. They made it feel like we were living in a home in the tropics. We then walked along the Des Moines River.

Finally, we hiked along Walnut Creek and the Raccoon River in the Linden Heights neighborhood. It felt very similar to the Kenwood/Lake of the Isles part of Minneapolis.

### Day 3

we checked out of our Airbnb, packed the car, and drove to [Pella, Iowa](https://www.cityofpella.com/). We walked around the town and thought hm, this is ok. There's a giant wooden windmill in the middle of town, turning in the wind. [It's the largest working wooden windmill in the US](https://www.visitpella.com/do/pella_historical_village_vermeer_mill/). Then we went inside the building and discovered that they had a tour of the inside of the windmill and a large museum. We were there on one of the few days of the year when they were grinding wheat into flour. We walked up into the interior of the windmill and saw how the gears and stones converted wind power into grinding power. The windwill blades had cloth sails on them, and the sound of the blades passing the door made it sound like a sailboat on the sea.

After the windmill, we toured the museum. We learned about all aspects of Dutch life, and how they brought varying traditions of the Dutch provinces to the US. The coolest part was seeing the miniature Dutch town. Each building was a replica of an actual building in the Netherlands.

We tried some S bread (S is for Sinterklaas) and fudge as well from local shops. We then drove to the Amana Nature Trail in the [Amana Colonies](https://amanacolonies.com/). It's a nice trail through the woods that has spectacular views of the Iowa River valley.

After that, we drove to Cedar Rapids, checked into our [hotel](https://www.bestwestern.com/en_US/book/hotels-in-cedar-rapids/best-western-plus-longbranch-hotel-convention-center/propertyCode.16071.html) and got some [dinner](https://www.tourismcedarrapids.com/directory/crosbys/). Cedar Rapids is an old industrial city that's undergoing a lot of rejuvenation. I've seen my share of decaying midwestern cities, so this was great to see.

### Day 4

We woke up to an unexpected snowstorm that dumped 6" of heavy wet snow overnight. The forecast had been for rain, so this definitely turned Friday into an indoor day. We went to the [National Czech and Slovak Museum and Library](https://ncsml.org/). It was interesting to hear about how important freedom was and is to not only native-born Americans but especially those fleeing regimes in unfree parts of the world. It gave me a new appreciation for what we have.

After that, we drove straight home to Saint Paul. Success!
