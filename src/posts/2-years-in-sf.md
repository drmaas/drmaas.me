12 insights all at once! What have I learned? What did I already know that's been reinforced?

* Become a business expert, while keeping your coding skills sharp.
* Continuously improve your ability to effectively communicate you ideas.
* Read the room and present to the audience in front of you.
* Practice drawing diagrams that show only the level of detail absolutely necessary to convey your ideas.
* Understand your domain of responsibility and role expectations. Partner with others when work falls outside of your domain and role.
  * This allows you to tackle problems that span domains and roles, while keeping your sanity.
* Avoid making yourself the gatekeeper for project progress.
* Avoid making yourself responsible for tracking project progress (unless you're a PM, in which case, please track project progress!)
* Avoid making yourself the gatekeeper of knowledge.
* Learn how to scale your impact. Delegate as much work as possible, and focus on where you add the most value.
* Do not be a complexifier.
* Make systems as simple as possible, but no simpler. It's ok to start with a complex design. Remove complexity until further removals would lead to unacceptable degradation.
