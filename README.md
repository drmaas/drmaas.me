[![Deploy Gatsby site to Pages](https://github.com/drmaas/drmaas.me/actions/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/drmaas/drmaas.me/actions/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml)

I generated the template for this blog using a [gatsbyjs community-created starter](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog/)

## :dizzy: Local Development

Run locally: `yarn dev`

## :rocket: Deploy

This project is setup with github actions. Any PR merge or direct push to main will trigger a build and deploy to the `gh-pages` branch. This in turn publishes the site to https://drmaas.github.io/drmaas.me, which is configured to be redirected to https://drmaas.me.

## :school: Learning Gatsby

Eventually it would be great to learn more about this tool.

Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/getting-started/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to our documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.
