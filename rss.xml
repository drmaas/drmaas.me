Finally. My biggest challenge will be coming up with content.
Some of my interests include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;software engineering (currently building out the digital platform &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.salesforce.com&quot;&gt;@salesforce&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin. I think of this in terms of ownership, store of value, and payments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crypto. Separate from Bitcoin. Mainly Ethereum. I think of this as a distributed computer for the internet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Politics and Economics. How does our government work, what is it doing, and what should it reasonably be allowed to do?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health. This includes food, exercise, and mental health. I&apos;ve been practicing Yoga for 12+ years and have thoughts on how to heal mind and body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everything else. I like to learn about a wide variety of topics. Ultimately, I spend time making connections between seemingly unrelated realms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll write a lot more interesting things in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
